🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: Python

Vectorization: TfidfVectorizer (scikit-learn)

Model: MultinomialNB

Evaluation: Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score), Confusion Matrix

📖 Workflow
Data Preprocessing: removing punctuation/stopwords, and tokenization.

Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF to weigh terms based on their importance across the dataset.

Model Training: Training the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm on the vectorized training set.

Evaluation: Using the classification report and a confusion matrix to visualize true positives vs. false positives.
