🚀 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled text cleaning, including removing HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords to reduce noise.

Feature Engineering: Converted raw text into numerical vectors using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model.

Evaluation: Detailed analysis using Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports to ensure the model wasn't biased toward one sentiment.

Model Comparison: Documented the transition from a generative model (Naive Bayes) to a discriminative model (Logistic Regression).
