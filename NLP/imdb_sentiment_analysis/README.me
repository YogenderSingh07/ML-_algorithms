🚀 Overview
The goal was to move beyond basic Bag of Words (BoW) and apply NLP techniques to a large-scale, real-world dataset. I used a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is specifically designed for text data where features represent word frequencies.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Feature Extraction: CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)

Model: MultinomialNB

Library: scikit-learn

📊 Key Features & Hyperparameters
To optimize the model, I focused on:

Stop Words: Removed common English words (the, is, a) to focus on sentiment-bearing words.

Vocabulary Management: Used sparse matrices to efficiently handle the large volume of unique words in the reviews.

📈 Results
The model's performance was evaluated using a test split, resulting in the following:

Model Accuracy
Accuracy Score: 85.05

Metric	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Negative	0.83	   0.87   0.85
Positive	0.87	   0.83   0.85
